# GEOG_576_Final
We are creating a web app that allows law enforcement agencies to geolocate and inventory pieces of evidence.  The data entered will be stored in a database by timestamp, case number, employee ID, and location then displayed on the map with a marker to look for overlapping patterns, and to promote awareness between different police departments.
